# Coffee-Shop-Daily-Revenue-Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the daily revenue of a coffee shop using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various business factorsâ€”such as customer footfall, order values, marketing spend, and operational efficiencyâ€”we aim to develop an accurate revenue prediction model.

We explored the dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), selected key features using feature importance analysis, and trained models including Ridge Regression and Random Forest. The final model achieved a strong RÂ² score of 0.9294 with an RMSE of 262.21, ensuring a balanced trade-off between accuracy and generalization.

Key Steps in the Project
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding key patterns and trends
âœ… Feature Engineering & Selection: Identifying the most important factors affecting revenue
âœ… Model Training & Evaluation: Comparing Ridge Regression & Random Forest models
âœ… Final Prediction: Generating revenue predictions based on business metrics

Results & Insights
ðŸ“Œ Most Important Factors: Customer count, average order value, marketing efficiency
ðŸ“Œ Best Model: Ridge Regression (Generalization) & Random Forest (Higher Accuracy)
ðŸ“Œ Final RÂ² Score: 0.9294 (Good Predictive Power)
ðŸ“Œ Final RMSE: 262.21 (Error reduced significantly)

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in the food & beverage industry, helping coffee shop owners optimize marketing spend, staffing, and operational hours for better revenue.
